# Alerts Module

This module manages Grafana Cloud alerting configuration including alert rules, contact points, and notification policies.

## Features

- Alert rules for SFP monitoring (temperature, optical power, interface status)
- Data source health monitoring and error detection
- Contact point configuration for email notifications
- Notification policies with grouping and timing rules
- Integration with Grafana Cloud alerting
- Intelligent handling of temporary data source issues and evaluation delays

## Alert Rules

This module creates the following alert rules:

1. **SFP Monitoring Data Source Issues** - Detects data source connectivity problems, timeouts, and evaluation delays
2. **SFP Temperature Critical** - Alerts when SFP temperature exceeds critical threshold of 80Â°C (with proper value formatting)
3. **SFP RX Power Too Low** - Alerts when RX power drops below -30.0 dBm (lower bound)
4. **SFP RX Power Too High** - Alerts when RX power exceeds -20.0 dBm (upper bound)
5. **SFP Data Stale** - Detects when SFP modules stop reporting fresh data
6. **SFP Vendor Serial Changed** - Alerts on SFP module replacements or changes
7. **Interface Link Down** - Alerts when monitored interfaces go down
8. **ONT CPU High** - Alerts when ONT CPU usage is high
9. **ONT PON Link Down** - Alerts when ONT loses connectivity to OLT

## Alert Features

- All numeric alerts include properly formatted values (e.g., "%.2f" for dBm, "%.1f" for temperature)
- Intelligent handling of missing data and evaluation delays
- Clear descriptions including both current values and thresholds
- Proper interface labeling for multi-interface setups
- Rate-based detection for certain metrics to handle missing scrapes
